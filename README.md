The purpose of this lab is to be able to create a few modules and be able to create the testbenches to demonstrate the correct waveforms. In this lab, the assignment included an SR latch and SR FlipFlop, a D flip flop using synchronous and asynchronous reset, a T flip flop with a 3-bit counter, and a clock divider at 25 MHz frequency. All of these different types of latches, flip flops, counters, and clock dividers were demonstrated conceptually during the lecture, and the students needed to be able to apply those conceptual ideas to write the Verilog code and testbench for them.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9456e2bb-10f4-4952-9b31-393fe08a233b)
